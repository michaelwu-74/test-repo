  <h1 id='txt'>Sustainable cities and communities: making our settlements better places</h1>
  <p id='txt'>Often now, we find ourselves in an increasingly complex society that seems to further   stray from social, environmental and economic goals. As seen with high housing prices, places that become impossible to navigate without personal transportation, and dwindling resources that are available to people living in these communities. <br></br >We will go over how to make our communities more sustainable by making them more environmentally friendly, more accessible to its citizens, and economically viable without ruining the future prospects of this or other communities.
